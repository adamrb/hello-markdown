# Hello World

This is a test, this is only a test

# Are you a human or are you a replicant?
## You’re in a desert walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down, and you see a tortoise, it’s crawling toward you. You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back. The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over, but it can’t, not without your help. But you’re not helping. Why is that?
1. What do you mean, I'm not helping?
1. What is a tortoise?
1. I don't know why I would flip the turtle over in the first place

*what do you mean, I'm not helping?*

*how can she not know what she is*

## ~~Sarah wishes she was as cool as me~~

~~She really does~~

## Adam knows that Sarah is already cooler than he is
He just won't admit it.
But he knows.
*we all know*
